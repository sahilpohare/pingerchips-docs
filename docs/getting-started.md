# Getting Started

Let's discover **Pingerchips in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Pingerchips is a service that is compatible with Pusher, and it is a service that allows you to send realtime events to your users.
We will be using the Pingerchips Javascript SDK to send events to our users in this example.

## Setting up the project

Log into your [Pingerchips Account](https://dashboard.pingerchips.com/dashboard/apps) and create a new app. You will be given a `Pingerchips App ID` and a `Pingerchips Key` and `Pingerchips App Secret`. You will need these to initialize the SDK.

:::note

You cannot have same `APP NAME` in one account

You are now ready to install the Pingerchips SDKs to start sending events to your users.
